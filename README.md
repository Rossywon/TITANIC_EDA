# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to explore factors affecting passenger survival.  
The analysis was performed using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 🔬 Project Objective

The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to identify:

- Survival rates based on gender
- Impact of passenger class on survival
- Age distribution of passengers
- Embarkation statistics
- Correlation between fare and survival

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

- **Dataset**: Titanic passenger data  
- **Source**: Kaggle Titanic dataset / public dataset  
- **Features**:
  - `Survived` — Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
  - `Pclass` — Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
  - `Sex` — Gender
  - `Age` — Age in years
  - `SibSp` — Number of siblings/spouses aboard
  - `Parch` — Number of parents/children aboard
  - `Fare` — Ticket fare
  - `Embarked` — Port of embarkation

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- Majority of passengers were male (~65%).
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate (~74%) compared to males (~19%).
- 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate (~62%).
- Median age of passengers was around 28 years.
- Passengers who paid higher fares had slightly higher survival rates.
- Southampton was the most common port of embarkation.
